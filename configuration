PROJECT: Installing openWrt on a raspberrypi.

1** Installing an Operating System on the Raspberry
      From the Raspbian website https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ I download the Raspbian software and copy it to the Raspberry SD card
      I create an empty file in the SD card using the command # touch /volumes/boot ssh on the prompt. Then I assign an IP address to Raspberry 
      using a configuration file called wpa_supplicant.conf that I create and edited using nano to put the raspberry in my home network. 
      The command is nano wpa_supplicant.cont.
      
      country=US
      ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
      update_config=1
      network={
      scan_ssid=1
      ssid=“MY-NETWORK-NAME"
      psk=“MY WiFi password"
      }
      Another method of configuring the raspberrypi to be part of my network is to use the configuration button on the battom right of the imager and checking the 
      the appropriete option to anable ssh, SSID and writing the WI-FI name and password and you hit the save botton.

      After creating those two files, I eject the SD card and on my computer to insert it on the Raspberry. I ssh to the raspberry using the its IP address given by 
      my home router. The command is #ssh pi@192.168.1.112 the I put the password which is raspberry, I answer yes to the prompt gain to gainaccess to the Raspberry but
      it didn't work. To access to my raspsberrypi I utilize an HDMI cable to connect it to the my televison and and enable VNC then I used its IP address to connect to 
      it using virtual network connection (VNC).
      Once I was in the Raspberry CLI I type the folowing command: raspi-config then type enter to display the configuration options. Use the arrow keys to select
      Interfacing Options and press Enter.
      Use the arrow keys to select VNC and press Enter.
      You will be prompted to enable VNC Server.
      The second method is to ssh

2**. Installing the openWrt on the Raspbian:**
      I flash the openWrt image to a micro SD card using the open source one from the Raspberry Pi team 
      "link https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-imager-imaging-utility/".
      Once complete insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and I booted it up. from a web browser, I type it's IP address then I got access to the openWrt interface.
      From the the openWrt interface a lot of configuration can be done:
          1. Configuring an access point
          2. Creation VLAN
          3. Using the raspberrypi as the LAN router
          4.Using the raspberrypi as DNS or a DHCP server
          5. Configuring a firewall and difining rules for ingress and outgress trafic as well as bolcking and opening ports.
